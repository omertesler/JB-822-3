/**
 * A Palindrome is a sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward.
 * Examples: anna, civic, kayak, level, madam,...
 * We will consider only numbers that can be called Palindrome. For example: 1001, 242, 99988999,...
 * The program will ask the user to enter a number (int), between 0 and 1,000,000,000.
 * It will check the input and proceed only when the input is finally correct.
 * If the input is NOT a Palindrome it will print a suitable message and finish.
 * Else, it will print the following (see examples next):
 * 1: the length of the number
 * 2: the first part of the Palindrome with spaces between the characters
 * 3: the second part of the Palindrome with spaces between the characters
 * NOTES:
 * 1. You must use ONLY things we learned (don't depend on string manipulations for example)
 * 2. Leading zeros don't count. For example, 00100 is NOT a Palindrome because the real number is 100
 *
 * Examples:
 * 1. Input: 13531
 *    Output: size = 5
 *    First part = 1 3 5      (with a space between each 2 characters)
 *    Second part = 5 3 1     (with a space between each 2 characters)
 * 2. Input: 98433489
 *    Output: size = 8
 *    First part = 9 8 4 3      (with a space between each 2 characters)
 *    Second part = 3 4 8 9     (with a space between each 2 characters)
